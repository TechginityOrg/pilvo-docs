The Plivo API uses HTTP verbs and standard HTTP status codes to make it easier for you to integrate communications into your code. To secure your requests to our servers, we serve our API over HTTPS.

If youâ€™re looking for our client SDKs, you can find them at iOS SDK, Android SDK, and Browser SDK.

Note: The current version of the API is v1, and the server SDKs are versioned as latest and legacy.
